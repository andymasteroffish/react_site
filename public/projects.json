The game itself is roughly based on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m86ftny1uY'>Combat for the Atari 2600</a>. When it starts, all ships are created with a completely randomized set of rules that govern their behavior. Once all of the ships in a given generation get a chance to compete, the ones that got the most kills (with a bonus for not dying themselves) are allowed to continue to the next generation and to have children. The children inherit the same set of behaviors that the parents had, but mutate them slightly: a value gets changed here and there, maybe a rule gets removed or a new one gets added. Even though these changes are random, over many generations the natural selection process selects for mutations that make them more effective pilots.<br><br><a href='http://www.andymakesgames.com/extras/combatgenetics/'>Full site here</a><br>Also avalaible on <a href='https://andymakes.itch.io/combat-genetics'>itch.io</a>",
