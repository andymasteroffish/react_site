Pac-Tracer is a programatic animation that examines the elegance and liveliness of the original Pac-Man AI, developed in 1980, by following the paths of Pac-Man and the four ghosts through an extruded 3D maze. Pac-Man’s AI represents some of the earliest and still most compelling work in games AI, with simple rules evoking the sense that each ghost has its own personality and own predispositions for mischief.<br><br>The rules that define the ghost movement are not truly adversarial: rather, they are about spatial desires. Each ghost has a place they want to be relative to Pac-Man and their fellow ghosts. This project allows those desires to play out unfettered by concerns about gamestate, or for that matter, any human interloper. By tracing those paths through the maze, the idiosyncrasies and personalities emerging from those rules become clear. What was a hunt now looks more like a waltz of attraction.<br><br>To compliment the web-app, I created a series of <a href='http://andymakes.com/?p=plotter_prints/pac_path'>plotter drawings</a> from frames of the animation.<br><br>You can view Pac-Tracer on the <a href='https://generative-unfoldings.mit.edu/works/pac-tracer/view.html'>Generative Unfoldings website.</a>",

When it starts, all ships are created with a completely randomized set of rules that govern their behavior. Once all of the ships in a given generation get a chance to compete, the ones that got the most kills (with a bonus for not dying themselves) are allowed to continue to the next generation and to have children. The children inherit the same set of behaviors that the parents had, but mutate them slightly: a value gets changed here and there, maybe a rule gets removed or a new one gets added. Even though these changes are random, over many generations the natural selection process selects for mutations that make them more effective pilots.<br><br><a href='http://www.andymakesgames.com/extras/combatgenetics/'>Full site here</a><br>Also avalaible on <a href='https://andymakes.itch.io/combat-genetics'>itch.io</a>",

By manipulating a set of smart balls, users convert real world action into a fluid sound-scape that affords play and exploration. The system as a whole has two unique modes of interaction: Free Form and Singing Bowl, and users learn the rules of these systems while interacting with the balls. The balls themselves have unique attributes in both their hardware and the way the information from them is converted into sound. The information is gathered from each ball by an implanted micro-controller and sent wirelessly to a computer where it is interpreted in order to create the sound.<br><br>Design Document: <a href='portfoliofiles/soundballsmaterials/SoundBallsWallace.pdf'>Here</a><br><br>Base Station Arduino Code: <a href='portfoliofiles/soundballsmaterials/BaseStationFinal.pde'>Here</a><br><br>Ball Transmitter Arduino Code: <a href='portfoliofiles/soundballsmaterials/BallTransmitterFinal.pde'>Here</a><br><br>Transmitter Wiring Diagram: <a href='portfoliofiles/soundballsmaterials/ballWiringDiagram.png'>Here</a><br><br>Receiver openFrameworks Code: <a href='portfoliofiles/soundballsmaterials/soundBallsReciever.zip'>Here</a><br><br>SuperCollider Code: <a href='portfoliofiles/soundballsmaterials/soundBalls.rtf'>Here</a>",

However, this consumes an unknown amount of time and causes the player to run the risk of being late.
